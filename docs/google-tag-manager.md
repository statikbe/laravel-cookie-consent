# How to configure Google Tag Manager

## Step 1: Create new variable
- Name: `GDPR Consent level` 
- Variable type: 1st Party Cookie
- Cookie Name: `__cookie_consent`

***If you change your cookie name in `cookie-consent.php`, don't forget to change this one too!***

## Step 2: Create trigger `GDPR - Has not given consent`
- Name: `GDPR - Has not given consent`
- Trigger type: Custom Event
- Event name: .* (regex.* triggers all types of events eg pageview, clicks, user engagement… )
- Tick 'Use regex matching'
- This trigger fires on: Some Custom Event
- Fire this trigger when GDPR consent level __matches__ RegEX `^(undefined|null|0|false|NaN|)$`
- `(^(undefined|null|0|false|NaN|)$` = RegEx to indicate that the cookie must have a value that is equel to  0, null, undefinded, false…)

### No tags found?
It's possible that there are no tags created yet. If that's the case, create a new one (click right top 'new')
Give it the name `Google Analytics` (Or you can give this another name, but keep that in mind when you follow the next steps).
 
 For Tag Type you choose `Google Analytics: Universal Analytics`.

## Step 4: Create `analytic cookies` trigger
- Name: `GDPR - Consent for analytical cookies`
- Trigger type: Custom Event
- Event name: .* 
- Tick 'Use regex matching'
- This trigger fires on: Some Custom Event
- Fire this trigger when GDPR Consent Level __does not match__ RegEx `2|true`
- (`2|true` = RegEx to indicate that the cookie can't have the value 2 OR true/1, this does mean that in combination with the previous exception, the value of the cookie should be 3 to fire the tag.)

## Step 5: Add `analytic cookies` trigger as exception to all analytic tags

- Trigger type: Custom Event
- Event name: .* 
- Tick 'Use regex matching'
- This trigger fires on: Some Custom Event
- Fire this trigger when GDPR Consent level __does not match__ RegEx `3|true`

(`3|true` = RegEx to indicate that the cookie can't have the value 3 OR true/1 , this does mean that in combination with the previous exception, the value of the cookie should be 2 to fire the tag.)
